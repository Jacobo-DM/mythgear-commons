# CodeTape  
Project 10: MythGear | Fox’s Anvil Commons

CodeTape is a low-cost, open-source sensing strip for land and sea.

It is an adhesive, segmentable strip containing simple sensors and low-power communication that can be placed in roads, gardens, homes, trails, marine systems, or shared infrastructure to signal conditions that matter to a community.

It is designed to be:
- biodegradable where possible
- locally encrypted
- governed by stewardship circles rather than proprietary control
- adaptable to local materials and needs

CodeTape is not a product.  
It is a commons blueprint for distributed care.

CodeTape operates in two layers:

1. Practical — a physical sensing strip with low-power communication.
2. Cultural — a reminder that infrastructure can be rooted in reciprocity rather than extraction.
