# CodeTape  
**Project 10: MythGear | Fox’s Anvil Commons**

CodeTape lives in two layers—one symbolic, one practical—both rooted in
care, reciprocity, and the ethics of the commons.

It is simultaneously:

---

## 1. A Symbol  
*A small, universal mark for shared creative work.*

CodeTape can be written on lessons, stories, games, drawings, movement
practices, recipes, open-hardware sketches, or anything offered freely to
others.

It signals a simple, human promise:

> **“This is part of the commons.  
> Use it, adapt it, share it, and leave the path better than you found it.”**  
> :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

It is not a contract.  
It is a gesture—an act of generosity instead of gatekeeping.

Anything marked with CodeTape says:

- do not extract  
- do not hoard  
- share with humility  
- honor the people and places the work came from  
- return more than you take  
  :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

This symbolic use of CodeTape will always remain simple.

## 2. A Toolkit  
*A low-cost, community-owned framework for building open, repairable tools.*

CodeTape is also a blueprint for creating small, open-source systems that 
listen to the land, sea, and weather—transparent, repairable, and free from 
corporate control.  
It was conceived as a gift of remembrance and reciprocity, meant to be copied,
rebuilt, and localized by communities who care for place, people, and 
ecological integrity.

Anything built with CodeTape must:

- remain open-source  
- stay in the commons  
- be community-guided  
- serve ecosystems and future generations  
  :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

This practical side of CodeTape includes:

- **patterns/** — simple strips, sensor paths, story circuits  
- **schematics/** — micro-nodes, connectors, safe child-friendly layouts  
- **classroom_kits/** — teacher guides, student cards, field activities  
- **materials/** — sustainable, low-cost sourcing and repair notes  
- **archive/** — early sketches and evolution notes  

These modules allow CodeTape to be built anywhere:  
classrooms, maker spaces, TurtleBack field desks, learning gardens, rooftops,
community workshops, and places where resources are scarce but creativity runs
strong.

## Why Two Identities?  
Because the world needs both.

- A **symbol** children, teachers, artists, and makers can use instantly with 
  no friction, no forms, no fear of ownership battles.

- A **toolkit** communities can use to build real devices that monitor, 
  restore, and protect the natural world—outside corporate control.

Both layers come from the same soil:

**reciprocity, openness, stewardship, and remembrance.**

## How to Use CodeTape  
**As a Symbol**  
Write “CodeTape” on your work, optionally adding:  
**“Offered freely as part of the commons. Adapt and share with care.”**  
Nothing more required.  
:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

**As a Toolkit**  
Follow the patterns, schematics, and material guides.  
Improve them. Remix them.  
Share locally and globally, as long as the work stays in the commons.

## Closing  
CodeTape is both a small open gate and a working set of tools.  
A gesture and a blueprint.  
A gift and a beginning.

If it helps you remember, protect, or restore the places you love,  
you are using it exactly as intended.
