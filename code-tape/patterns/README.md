# CodeTape Patterns
Movement, logic, and story circuits.

This folder contains printable and remixable templates that let students build:

- simple switches  
- movement sensors  
- story-linked interaction strips  
- circular and spiral circuits  
- cooperative circuits for group builds  

All patterns are designed to be assembled with everyday materials:
conductive tape, cardstock, foil, thread, or whatever a community has on hand.
