# DreamHearth
**A place where nothing is asked of you but rest.**

DreamHearth is a commons-based bedding system rooted in an older intelligence: warmth is made, not purchased; rest is held, not optimized.

It is a modular “nest + shell” configuration that can **welcome a human into the world**, **grow as they grow**, and later **return to a tighter nest** for aging, recovery, illness, or deep fatigue—always with dignity.

## First principle: Right to Rest
Rest is not a luxury.  
Rest is not a reward.  
Rest is a basic human right.

DreamHearth is built to support nervous-system settling through:
- **containment without confinement**
- **warmth without pressure**
- **support without restraint**
- **quiet without surveillance**

---

## What DreamHearth is (and refuses to be)

### This is
- a threshold object: a place you cross into rest
- natural-fiber-forward (breathable, tactile, non-shiny)
- modular and repairable
- able to scale from infant to elder without changing its core geometry

### This is not
- a pod, sack, or restraint
- a “sleep optimization” device
- a tracked or monitored system
- a medicalized “solution”

No zippers. No compression. No alarms. No data.

## Core geometry
DreamHearth is three cooperating elements:

### 1) The Nest (below and around)
Modular pillows/bolsters arranged *around* the body to support curling, side-sleeping, and turning.

### 2) The Shell (head shelter)
A slightly lowered head-rest with a **hooded rim** that curves forward like a soft hood:
- narrows the visual field
- dampens sound
- provides protection without covering the face

### 3) The Weave (movement-friendly containment)
Optional arm pockets / side folds that allow easy in/out and rolling.

## Lifecycle configurations

### Arrival (infant)
- tighter nest, deeper warmth
- softer sound and light
- minimal visual field

### Opening (child)
- modular supports, tactile comfort
- movement welcomed
- “quiet edge” at the head for reassurance

### Widening (adult)
- same geometry with more space
- lighter containment
- shell becomes a “quiet rim” rather than an enclosure

### Return (aged / recovering)
- tighter nest to reduce effort and prevent fatigue spirals
- gentle orientation cues (texture/seams rather than color reliance)
- warmth and support that preserve dignity

---

## Materials (guidance, not dogma)
DreamHearth favors fibers that feel like “home” and age well.

**Primary textiles**
- hemp (structure, breathability, sound dampening)
- jute (texture, scent, grounding)
- raw cotton (face-safe lining)

**Fill**
- wool, kapok, loose natural fiber, layered batting
- avoid bouncy/“spring-back” fills when possible

**Rule of thumb**
If it wouldn’t feel right for a newborn, it doesn’t belong.

---

## Safety & dignity line (non-negotiable)
DreamHearth must always:
- allow easy exit (fail-open)
- preserve choice and comfort
- avoid restraint, locking, compression, or forced positioning
- avoid surveillance, sensors, or “compliance” framing

If a “safety feature” violates dignity, it does not belong.

## Repository contents (suggested structure)
- `/docs/` — narrative + principles + notes
- `/patterns/` — cut patterns, written instructions, material notes
- `/configs/` — infant/child/adult/return configuration guides
- `/research/` — references (sleep hygiene, sensory comfort, natural fibers, etc.)
- `/license/` — license text(s)

---

## License (commons-forward suggestion)
Choose what matches your intent. Two common approaches:

1) **Docs/text**: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA 4.0)  
2) **Hardware/patterns**: CERN Open Hardware Licence (CERN-OHL-S or CERN-OHL-P)

This repo can also start with **CC BY-SA 4.0 for everything** and later split if needed.

---

## Status
Early stage. This repo is an anchor for:
- the DreamHearth concept + ethics
- modular configuration language
- commons patterns (written first, diagrams later)

If you make a DreamHearth in your home or community, please share adaptations so the commons can learn.
