# MythGear Card — Hands Listen  
**Micro-listening sequence**

1. Place your palm on bark, stone, metal, or ground.
2. Soften the hand. Let weight settle.
3. Wait for temperature shift or faint vibration.
4. Add 1–2 mm micro-movements.
5. Notice changes in:
   - buzz
   - density
   - echo
   - texture
6. Switch hands.
7. Repeat on a new surface.

**Reminder:**  
Hands are not gripping.  
Hands are gathering.
