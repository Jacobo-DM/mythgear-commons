# MythGear Card — Pulse Bridge  
**Hands + feet integration**

1. Trace slow infinity circles with your hands.
2. Breathe into your back body.
3. Add small steps — quiet landings.
4. Let palms sense → spine translate → feet echo.
5. Then reverse:
   feet sense → spine translate → palms echo.
6. Find one unified rhythm.
7. Practice until the whole body listens.

**Reminder:**  
When hands and feet hear each other,  
you are already in the field-state.
