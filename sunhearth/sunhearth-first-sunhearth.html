        A winter tale for Circle of Warmth, Discovery Mode, and story circles.

    <article class="story-card">
      <p>
        Long ago, before schools had windows and before cities had lights,
        there was a winter so cold that even the stones seemed to forget their warmth.
      </p>
      <p>
        A small group of wanderers gathered in a wooden hut at the edge of a forest.
        Their firewood was gone. All that remained were a few things they carried from place to place:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a metal bowl,</li>
        <li>a small cup,</li>
        <li>a scrap of bright foil,</li>
        <li>a single candle stub,</li>
        <li>and a round stone from a river.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One of the wanderers, a child named Lira, whispered,
        “We have no fire big enough to keep us warm.”
      </p>
      <p>
        An elder shook their head gently.
        “Little one,” they said, “heat does not only come from size.
        It comes from <em>shape</em> — and from <em>attention</em>.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Together they placed the candle in the small cup,
        set the cup inside the bowl, bent the bright foil above it like a small dome,
        and rested the river stone on top like a guardian.
      </p>
      <p>
        When they lit the tiny flame, something unexpected happened.
        Not just the bowl, not just the cup, but the whole circle
        began to feel gently warm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wanderers leaned closer. They told stories. They watched the shadows move.
        They measured how far the warmth reached with their hands and with their breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        All winter, they survived with that little SunHearth —
        not because it was powerful on its own,
        but because they gathered around it together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lira grew up to become a teacher.
        Whenever a room felt cold, she would smile and say:
      </p>
      <p>
        “Come. Bring your hands. The smallest flame is waiting.”
      </p>
    </article>

    <p class="footer-note">
      Teachers can read this aloud to open the Circle of Warmth lesson, and then invite students to
      imagine what objects they might carry if they had to build a SunHearth of their own —
      <em>only in story, only in class, only with safety first</em>.
