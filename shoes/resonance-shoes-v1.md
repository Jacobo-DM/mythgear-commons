# MythGear Shoes v1 — Jute Rail + Resonance Plate

**Module:** MythGear Commons  
**Authors:** Elumannín + Jacobo  
**Status:** v1 design spec (concept + field-testing welcome)

## 1. Intent

Feet that can **remember** where they’ve been.

MythGear Shoes v1 are minimalist movement shoes designed for RageDance,
trail wandering, and urban stealth. They emphasize:
- ground feel over cushioning
- clean lines over bulk
- feedback over numbness

The core features are:
- a continuous **Achilles rail** that wraps heel → sides → toe
- a midfoot **resonance plate** that amplifies subtle vibrations
- a **leaf-sole insert** with a jute massage layer

Together with MythGear Gloves v1:
> Hands listen. Feet remember.

## 2. Upper

### 2.1 Base Material

- soft hybrid textile (linen / cotton / jute blend or similar)
- priority: breathable, quick-drying, tough enough for trail scuffs
- minimal internal seams to reduce hot spots

### 2.2 Outer Achilles Rail

A continuous structural band that runs:

> mid-Achilles → around heel → along lateral and medial sides → up to toe shield

Functions:
- gentle heel lock without stiff plastic
- lateral support for side-steps, pivots, and low stances
- visual motif that echoes the “pulse lane” on the gloves

Material options:
- layered jute webbing
- jute + rubber laminate strip
- optional thin conductive path (for future CodeTape integration)

### 2.3 Toe Shield

- reinforced toe cap integrated into the rail
- protects against roots, stones, and accidental kicks
- should not feel like a hard wall; slight flex is ideal

---

## 3. Sole

### 3.1 Overall Profile

- minimalist and flexible
- stack height target: 8–12 mm total (including insole)
- zero drop or very close (0–2 mm difference heel-to-toe)

### 3.2 Traction

- shallow multi-directional pattern
- designed for:
  - mixed urban surfaces (concrete, tile, asphalt)
  - dry trail (dirt, small rocks, roots)
- avoid deep lugs that add bulk or catch on dance surfaces

---

## 4. Resonance Plate

A slightly stiffer insert embedded in the midfoot of the sole:

- **Material options:**
  - thin wood (bamboo, birch) sealed for moisture
  - composite plate (carbon + plant resin)
- **Dimensions:**
  - length: centered under arch + a bit forward toward the ball
  - thickness: 1–2 mm
- **Goal:**
  - subtly amplify ground vibrations during walking, running, and RageDance
  - give a “note” back to the foot during landings and pushes

The plate should not feel like a rigid shank. Think:
> “Gentle echo board” rather than “hard plank.”

## 5. Insert System

### 5.1 Leaf-Sole Base

- removable, flexible insert shaped like a leaf
- follows main curves of the foot rather than a perfect shoe outline
- materials:
  - natural fiber felt (jute, wool, or blend)
  - thin rubberized underside for grip

### 5.2 Arch Pocket

- a small cavity or band in the mid-arch area
- designed to hold:
  - a jute knot
  - a thin felt pad
  - or a small stone / token (for ritual use, with safety limits)

Symbolic function:
> “The arch remembers the path.”

### 5.3 Jute Massage Layer

Optional top layer:

- woven or knotted jute zones under:
  - ball of foot
  - outer edge
  - heel
- offers gentle pressure during walking and dance
- encourages micromovements in the toes and arch

---

## 6. Fit & Closure

- low collar to respect ankle mobility
- simple closure (laces or strap) that can be repaired in the field
- heel cup should cradle, not clamp

Fit target:
- secure enough for low lunges, quick cuts, and spins
- loose enough in the forefoot for toe spread

---

## 7. Use Cases

### 7.1 RageDance

- allow circular, infinity-style movements without fighting the foot
- provide clear feedback when landing from small jumps
- pair with gloves to explore full-body pulse waves

### 7.2 Trail & Urban Movement

- walk and run on mixed terrain while keeping sensory contact with ground
- light enough to carry as “field slippers” when switching from boots
- good for urban stealth: quiet steps, soft landings

### 7.3 Somatic Literacy Training

Suggested drills:

1. **Texture Walk**
   - walk barefoot, then with MythGear Shoes, over different textures
   - notice what changes in the resonance plate and jute layers

2. **Rail Line**
   - trace painted lines, curbs, or fallen branches as balance beams
   - feel how the Achilles rail supports side-to-side corrections

3. **Echo Steps**
   - on a wooden floor or bridge, practice slow steps
   - listen for how the resonance plate “answers” each landing

---

## 8. Open Questions (for future versions)

- Ideal balance between durability and compostability in the sole?
- Best way to make the rail repairable with simple tools?
- Should there be a “water-compatible” variant for wet environments?
