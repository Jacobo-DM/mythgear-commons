<h1>MythGear Commons</h1>

<p><strong>Elumannín + Jacobo</strong></p>

<p>
MythGear Commons is an open hardware / open storywork lab for movement medicine:
gloves, shoes, field-kits, and resonance tools that help people listen with their
whole bodies – in the garden, on the trail, and in the city.
</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Design gear that supports <strong>somatic literacy</strong> – learning through movement, breath, and touch.</li>
  <li>Keep everything as <strong>commons-friendly</strong> as possible: repairable, remixable, and shareable.</li>
  <li>Bridge <strong>MythWear</strong>, <strong>RageDance</strong>, <strong>CodeTape</strong>, and other Flower Road projects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Current Modules</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>CodeTape</strong> – low-cost sensing patterns and conductive paths for resonance tracking.</li>
  <li><strong>MythGear Gloves v1</strong> – resonance-cup palms for listening through impact and contact. (in progress)</li>
  <li><strong>MythGear Shoes v1</strong> – jute + Achilles rail + resonance plate for trail and RageDance. (planned)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design Principles</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Jute &amp; Grit</strong> – favor natural fibers, tactile feedback, and honest materials.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-use</strong> – every element should do more than one thing when possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Local repair</strong> – designs should be fixable with simple tools and community skill.</li>
  <li><strong>Open patterns</strong> – share patterns and blueprints under Creative Commons licenses.</li>
</ul>
