# MythGear Levels (v1)  
**Elumannín + Jacobo**  
*A progression of sensing, movement literacy, and resonance fluency.*

MythGear levels are not ranks.  
They are stages of **listening capacity**.

You move through them naturally, quietly, at your own rhythm.
They are not tests.  
They are recognitions.

# LEVEL 1 — SURFACE LISTENER  
*“I can feel the world again.”*

### Core Skills
- Micro-listening (palms)
- Echo-walking (feet)
- Basic infinity tracing with hands
- Quiet landings
- Breath awareness during movement

### Indicators
- You begin to notice differences between surfaces.
- You feel when your hands and feet are “awake.”
- You can return to calm through touch and breath.

### Tools
- Gloves (optional)  
- Shoes (optional)  
- Cards: Hands Listen, Feet Remember  

---

# LEVEL 2 — FIELD READER  
*“The world answers back.”*

### Core Skills
- Using resonance cup + resonance plate as a pair  
- Reading surfaces: bark, stone, metal, ground, railings  
- Mapping tension through the spine  
- Coordinating breath with movement arcs  
- Detecting small pulses and echoes

### Indicators
- You feel the “direction” of a vibration.  
- You notice when your feet want to rotate before your hands, or vice versa.  
- You sense micro-shifts in balance from lateral rails or uneven terrain.

### Tools
- Gloves + Shoes recommended  
- Cards: Pulse Bridge  
- Field Protocol v1  

---

# LEVEL 3 — PULSE WEAVER  
*“Movement becomes message.”*

### Core Skills
- Translating sensation → movement → breath → sensation  
- Creating intentional “echoes” through the body  
- Integrating hands + feet in real time  
- Fluid infinity patterns (vertical, horizontal, diagonal)  
- Stealth movement on mixed terrain

### Indicators
- You can feel where movement originates.  
- You can soften or amplify a pulse on command.  
- You can “ride” subtle terrain changes without breaking rhythm.

### Tools
- Gloves + Shoes  
- Field circuits (coming soon)  
- Early RageDance integration  

---

# LEVEL 4 — RESONANCE RUNNER  
*“The field is alive, and I am part of it.”*

### Core Skills
- Moving through a landscape as if reading a story  
- Fast quiet transitions  
- Dynamic balance on rails, stones, roots  
- Controlled impacts with instant recovery  
- Multi-surface literacy (urban + trail)

### Indicators
- Surfaces begin to feel like languages.  
- You anticipate changes in ground without looking.  
- You can land silently from small heights.

### Tools
- Full MythGear Set  
- RageDance sequences  
- Field cards (advanced)  

---

# LEVEL 5 — FIELDKEEPER  
*“My presence supports the field.”*

This is not mastery — it is stewardship.

### Core Skills
- Teaching others without forcing or correcting  
- Holding group rhythm  
- Reading emotional and energetic shifts through movement  
- Knowing when to soften, when to pause, when to breathe  
- Integrating MythGear with story, ecology, and place

### Indicators
- Your movement calms others.  
- You create safety without saying a word.  
- You move with the terrain rather than on it.

### Tools
- MythGear + RageDance  
- Field rituals  
- Story integration (Discovery Mode, Flower Road)

# NOTES ON PROGRESSION
- You may move up and down naturally.  
- Levels may overlap.  
- Experience in one domain accelerates another.  
- This path is gentle, circular, and ecological.

**The goal is not to advance.  
The goal is to awaken.**

---

# NEXT STEPS
- Level-based field circuits  
- Partner resonance drills  
- Night protocols  
- Weather protocols (fog, wind, cold, heat)  
- Integration with CodeTape sensing paths
