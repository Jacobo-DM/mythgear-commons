# MythGear Gloves v1 — Resonance-Cup Palms

**Module:** MythGear Commons  
**Authors:** Elumannín + Jacobo  
**Status:** v1 design spec (field-testing welcome)

---

## 1. Intent

Hands that can **listen**.

MythGear Gloves v1 are designed for RageDance, trail movement, and everyday
somatic literacy. The core feature is a shallow **resonance cup** in the
center of each palm, tuned to amplify micro-vibrations on bark, stone, metal,
and doorframes.

Use them to:
- feel impact and ground reaction more clearly
- practice “pulse wave” awareness through touch
- send and receive simple, silent codes

## 2. Palm Architecture

### 2.1 Resonance Cup

- **Position:** centered between the main palmar creases.
- **Diameter:** 38–42 mm
- **Depth:** 3–5 mm
- **Profile:** smooth concave curve (no sharp angles).

The cup should be firm enough to transmit vibration, with just enough give
to remain comfortable during repeated impact.

### 2.2 Cup Linings (Modular)

The cup can be lined or filled with different removable inserts, each
emphasizing a different “voice”:

- **Porous jute felt**
  - rougher, higher-frequency feel
  - best for bark, dry stone, and rope

- **Silicone membrane**
  - slightly damped, deeper feel
  - best for metal railings, doorframes, and floorwork

- **Wood / bone disk**
  - brightest, most resonant feedback
  - good for “stone tap” codes and rhythm drills

Inserts should be:
- 1–2 mm thick
- easy to remove and replace without tools
- usable even if they get dusty or damp

## 3. Outer Palm

**Material:** jute–rubber composite  
- 65–70% jute fiber  
- 30–35% natural rubber or similar elastomer

**Goal:** maintain grip with honest texture. Slightly abrasive is OK.

### 3.1 Flex Channels

Shallow channels aligned with the three main palmar lines:

- improve flex during fist, open-hand strikes, and infinity circles
- prevent the palm from feeling “board-stiff”
- reduce material fatigue at crease lines

---

## 4. Back of Hand

**Material:** breathable woven textile  
- linen, jute blend, or other natural-fiber mesh
- priority: airflow + durability, not high insulation

### 4.1 Pulse Lane (Optional)

A narrow lane along the radial side (thumb side) of the wrist and forearm:

- can hold a thin, flexible conductive filament (for future CodeTape use)
- doubles as a tactile guide to the radial pulse
- symbolic rail: “signal line” between heart and palm

---

## 5. Fingers

### 5.1 Form

Options (to be tested in the field):

- **Half-finger design**
  - fingertips exposed for fine touch
  - good for writing, tying knots, operating tools

- **Minimal wraps**
  - individual wraps for index, middle, and thumb only
  - ideal for RageDance when floor contact is frequent

### 5.2 Reinforced Tips

Where covered, reinforce with:

- jute binding + plant-based resin hardening
- texture: slightly rough, stone-friendly
- use-case: “stone taps,” tree grips, rail balances

---

## 6. Fit & Sizing

- snug but not constricting
- secure wrist closure (simple jute strap, toggle, or elastic)
- avoid bulky closures that interfere with floorwork or wrist rolls

Design target: **enough structure to feel like gear,
light enough to forget you’re wearing them.**

## 7. Use Cases

### 7.1 RageDance

- amplify palm contact during strikes and ground sequences
- train “impact listening” instead of brute force
- combine with breath to explore pulse waves through the arms and spine

### 7.2 Trail & Urban Movement

- grip tree trunks, stones, and rails without tearing skin
- tap out simple rhythms as “I’m here” signals to partners
- feel subtle feedback from benches, walls, and handrails

### 7.3 Somatic Literacy Training

Suggested drills:

1. **Surface Library**
   - touch: bark, stone, metal, glass, packed earth, loose gravel
   - notice: what changes in the cup? the fingertips? the wrist?

2. **Silent Code**
   - with a partner, develop 3–5 simple tap patterns
   - practice sending and receiving without words

3. **Pulse Walk**
   - walk slowly, one hand on a wall or railing
   - track how the vibrations change with each step and breath

---

## 8. Open Questions (for future versions)

- Best base material mix for durability vs. compostability?
- Ideal insert set for a starter kit (two or three materials)?
- How much wrist support is helpful before it limits freedom of movement?
