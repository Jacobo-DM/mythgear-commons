# MythGear Gloves v1 — Resonance-Cup Palms
**Module:** MythGear Commons  
**Authors:** Elumannín + Jacobo  
**Status:** v1 build spec (in progress · field-testing welcome)

**Core line:** *Hands listen.*

---

## What this is
Gloves designed for listening through contact — bark, stone, metal, ground — and for RageDance / field practice where touch becomes a sensor.

This folder holds:
- the core build spec
- future pattern variants
- field notes and tuning

---

## Start here
- **Build spec:** [resonance-gloves-v1.md](resonance-gloves-v1.md)

---

## Use (micro-sequence)
1. Place palm on a surface (stone / bark / metal / ground).
2. Soften the hand. Let weight settle.
3. Wait for a temperature shift or faint vibration.
4. Add 1–2 mm micro-movements.
5. Notice changes: buzz · density · echo · texture
6. Switch hands. Repeat.

(See also: cards folder → *Hands Listen*.)

## Build snapshot (what we have so far)
**Palm architecture**
- Shallow concave “resonance cup” at the center of each palm (3–5 mm depth target)
- Optional porous jute lining
- Optional removable disk (wood / silicone / bone substitute) to change “note”

**Outer palm**
- Jute/rubber hybrid for grip + abrasion
- Flex channels aligned with palm lines

**Back of hand**
- Breathable woven textile
- Optional “pulse lane” along the radial line (future CodeTape integration)

---

## Next improvements (choose one at a time)
- Add photos / sketch of palm cup geometry
- Define cup depth + diameter options (S/M/L)
- Choose one “default” disk material for v1
- Add a simple field-testing checklist
- Add winter variant notes (thin liner + removable palm insert)

---

## Safety + care
- This is listening gear, not protective equipment.
- Avoid high heat, corrosives, sharp edges, and impacts that could injure the hand.
- If adding inserts/disks: ensure edges are smooth and cannot migrate.
