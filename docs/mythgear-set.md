# MythGear Set — Hands Listen, Feet Remember  
**Elumannín + Jacobo**

The MythGear Set is the pairing of two listening instruments:

- **MythGear Gloves v1** — palms that hear vibration  
- **MythGear Shoes v1** — feet that remember the ground

Individually, they heighten somatic literacy.  
Together, they form a full-body resonance rig for movement, awareness, and field practice.

## 1. Shared Design Principles

### 1.1 Jute & Grit  
Favor natural fibers, real textures, honest materials.  
If it teaches you something through feeling, it belongs here.

### 1.2 Multi-Purpose Components  
A resonance cup should:
- transmit vibration  
- help regulate the nervous system  
- allow silent communication

A rail should:
- support movement  
- provide sensory feedback  
- hold symbolic meaning  

Nothing exists for a single reason.

### 1.3 Repairable by Community  
All parts should be:
- fixable with simple tools  
- replaceable without proprietary hardware  
- friendly to local makers

This is open hardware for real humans, not tech silos.

## 2. Shared Structural Motifs

### Resonance Cup (Gloves)  
A shallow concave form at the palm center.  
Purpose:
- amplify micro-vibrations  
- help the nervous system down-shift  
- create a “listening point” for bark, stone, metal

### Resonance Plate (Shoes)  
A midfoot insert that echoes each step.  
Purpose:
- offer feedback during movement  
- teach landing softness and pulse timing  
- reveal subtle changes in terrain

These two resonance features speak to each other.

### The Rail  
- **Achilles Rail** on the shoes  
- **Pulse Lane** on the gloves  

Both create a path of sensation along the limb.  
Both imply a direction of force and attention.  
Both are continuous lines that help the body organize itself in motion.

## 3. How Gloves + Shoes Work Together

### 3.1 Pulse Wave Literacy  
Gloves amplify vibrations through the palms.  
Shoes return echoes through the arches.

Together they teach:
- impact modulation  
- joint timing  
- spiraling force (infinity patterns)  
- breath-movement coherence

### 3.2 Fieldwork & Trail Movement  
Gloves help sense bark, stone, rails, hollow logs.  
Shoes help sense ground density, slope, and micro-shifts.

Together:
- you read an environment through touch  
- you move with greater precision  
- you avoid unnecessary force  

### 3.3 RageDance  
Gloves = expression + listening in the upper body  
Shoes = grounding + memory in the lower body  

When worn as a pair:
- circular movement becomes smoother  
- strikes land with clarity rather than strain  
- floor sequences become safer  
- the body finds its natural rhythm faster

## 4. Aesthetic Unity

### Forms  
- cups  
- rails  
- woven lines  
- natural textures  
- minimalistic silhouettes  

### Materials  
- jute  
- wood  
- bone  
- rubber  
- plant resins  

### Symbolic Thread  
> Hands listen.  
> Feet remember.  
> The whole body becomes a field instrument.
