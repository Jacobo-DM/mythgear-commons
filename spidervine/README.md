# SpiderVine (SpiderLine)
**Body-powered line travel & movement gear for the commons.**

SpiderVine is a human-powered movement system for traveling along a suspended line or cable using the whole body—hands, core, and legs—rather than motors or passive glide.

It sits at the intersection of:
- movement medicine
- repairable mechanical design
- play, learning, and real-world utility

SpiderVine belongs to **MythGear** because it is not a vehicle in the consumer sense—it is *gear for inhabiting gravity*.

## What it is

SpiderVine is a **line-based traversal system** that can be configured in multiple ways, including:

- single-line or dual-line travel
- hand-cycle or quad-cycle mechanics
- integrated braking for speed and momentum control
- optional winch / pulley modes for utility and rescue

The body does the work.  
The line carries the path.

---

## What it’s for

- **Movement & conditioning**  
  Full-body engagement, coordination, and proprioception.

- **Learning through difficulty**  
  A steep learning curve by design—skill develops through attention, not automation.

- **Utility & resilience**  
  When equipped with a winch or pulley, SpiderVine can assist with:
  - lifting or hauling
  - waste pickup in difficult terrain
  - emergency or recovery scenarios
  - temporary access across gaps

- **Play (serious play)**  
  Fun is not an accident here—it’s how learning sticks.

---

## What it is not

- Not a zipline
- Not a motorized system
- Not a turnkey product
- Not optimized for speed or comfort first

SpiderVine prioritizes **control, feedback, and repairability** over convenience.

---

## Current status (honest note)

Some early design notes and sketches are currently missing or fragmented.
This page exists to **anchor the concept clearly** so it doesn’t dissolve into vagueness.

The idea is preserved.  
The details will be rebuilt—carefully.

---

## Design questions in progress

- Single cable vs dual cable tradeoffs
- Hand-cycle vs mixed hand/leg drive
- Brake ergonomics and safety margins
- Learning curve design (how steep is *useful*?)
- Modular attachments (winch, tool pickup, rescue)

These questions are features, not problems.

## Relationship to other MythGear

- **DreamHearth** — rest and return
- **SunHearth** — warmth and environmental safety
- **Gloves / Shoes** — sensing and ground contact
- **SpiderVine** — movement through space and gravity

Movement requires rest.  
Rest gives movement meaning.

---

## Commons intent

SpiderVine is intended as:
- open design
- community-repairable
- adaptable to local materials and needs

It will never require proprietary components to function.

---

## Status
Concept anchored.  
Design rebuilding in progress.
