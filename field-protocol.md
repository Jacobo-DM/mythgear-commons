MythGear Field Protocol v1
Hands listen. Feet remember. Body becomes the bridge.
This protocol teaches the three foundational skills of MythGear:
Micro-listening through the palms
Echo-walking through the feet
Pulse-wave integration through the spine
It can be done with or without MythGear Gloves + Shoes —
but the gear amplifies the learning.
1. Micro-Listening (Hands)
Duration: 3–5 minutes
Gear: Gloves optional (with resonance cups ideal)
Step A — Contact
Place your dominant-hand palm gently on a surface:
bark
stone
wall
ground
the side of a bench
a tree root
Let the palm sink into the micro-texture.
Step B — Wait for the Field
Hold still until you feel:
temperature shift
faint vibrations
an internal softening
slight electrical “buzz”
Do not force anything.
Let the surface speak at its own volume.
Step C — Micro-Movement
Now add 1 mm shifts — barely perceptible adjustments.
Notice how the resonance cup amplifies small signals.
Hands are not gripping. Hands are gathering.
Repeat with the other palm.
2. Echo-Walking (Feet)
Duration: 5 minutes
Gear: MythGear Shoes recommended (resonance plate ideal)
Step A — Quiet Step
Walk slowly and let the midfoot resonance plate “answer” each step.
Feel:
density changes in the ground
echo length
firmness vs. sponge
the difference between heel-first and ball-first steps
Step B — The Three Surfaces
If possible, walk on:
concrete or stone
dirt or grass
wood or bridge
Each surface teaches a different note.
Step C — The Floating Heel
Lift your heel slightly while walking.
Let your arch “taste the ground.”
Let the Achilles rail guide lateral balance.
Feet do not push the world.
Feet remember it.
3. Pulse-Wave Integration (Whole Body)
Duration: 3–7 minutes
Gear: Gloves + Shoes recommended together
Step A — Infinity Circles
With the gloves on, draw slow ∞ patterns with your hands.
Let the movement originate from your spine and ribs.
Step B — Breath Hook
Inhale into the back body.
Exhale as the hands complete the circle.
Slowly add small steps — soft landings, quiet feet.
Step C — The Bridge
Now let the palms and feet communicate:
palms sense → spine translates → feet echo
feet sense → spine translates → palms echo
This is the core of the MythGear practice.
When hands and feet are listening to each other,
you are already in the field-state.
4. Closing Gesture (Optional)
Touch thumb to the resonance cup.
Touch heel lightly to the ground.
One breath.
End.
5. Field Notes
Add your observations:
What surfaces taught you the most?
Did the resonance plate have a “voice”?
Did the pulse wave sync with breath?
Which infinity path felt most natural?
Understanding grows through noticing, not measuring.
