# HearthWheel
Project 10: MythGear | A Fox’s Anvil Open Resilience offering

HearthWheel is a local coordination hub for distributed care.

It lives in kitchens, living rooms, and shared spaces—where “weather” (needs, conditions, offers, and alerts) moves through a community without central control or extraction.

HearthWheel is built as:
- **6 petals + 1 core**
- modular, local-first, and repairable
- consent-based, dignity-preserving, and human-governed
- taught through story and felt memory, not compliance manuals

---

## Core principle
**This is infrastructure for care, not control.**

No surveillance.
No coercion.
No “optimization.”
No forced compliance.

---

## The HearthWheel model
### 1 core + 6 petals

**Core (always present)**
- hardware interface + power
- local storage
- timekeeping
- encryption / key management
- local connectivity (mesh capable)
- CodeTape gateway (distributed sensing + exchange)

**Petals (configurable)**
Petals can be added, removed, or swapped without breaking the system.
Each petal has:
- a simple interface (light / tactile / optional audio)
- a small set of actions
- a story envelope (a vignette that teaches use + ethics)

---

## The six petals (v1)
1) **Guardian**
Care coordination: medications, meals/water timing, exercise cues, records, visit prep.
- Boundary: no diagnosis, no dosing advice, no forced compliance.

2) **Home**
Household rhythms: pantry/fridge checks, safety cues, shared routines.

3) **Community**
Neighbor mesh: mutual aid, local alerts, shared seasonal “weather.”

4) **DiscoveryMode**
Curiosity prompts and learning trails. Child-centered inquiry.

5) **RageDance**
Return-to-body signals, movement rituals, regulation sequences.

6) **Regenerative Gaming**
Cooperative quests and repair play: garden tasks, cleanup, learning missions.

---

## Signals, not surveillance
HearthWheel treats information as **signals** that move through circles.

Signal types:
- **Reminder** (time-based)
- **Observation** (note, photo, plant bloom, symptom)
- **Condition** (sensor reading or manual check)
- **Need** (request support)
- **Offer** (availability/resources)
- **Alert** (hazard/community notice)

Each signal has:
- timestamp
- source (person/petal/CodeTape)
- visibility scope: self / household / trusted circle / neighborhood mesh
- expiry (so old info doesn’t haunt)

---

## “Weather passing through a community”
This is the story-first application layer.

Example:
- A CodeTape strip at a trail marker detects slick conditions (friction drop).
- A nearby HearthWheel receives **Condition: Trail slick**.
- A local steward shares it as a **Community Alert** with a 4-hour expiry.
- Neighbors add observations (photo, soil notes, mushroom bloom).
- The signal fades when it expires.

No platform. No feed. No extraction.
Just local awareness moving like weather.

---

## Governance
HearthWheel is governed by **stewardship circles**:
- communities decide what is shared
- permissions are transparent and reversible
- the system must fail-open (easy exit, no lock-in)

If a feature violates dignity, it does not belong.

---

## Hardware posture (public-facing, early)
HearthWheel is intended to be:
- low-power
- local-first
- repairable with common parts
- usable across ages and literacy levels
- able to operate without internet

Exact builds will evolve. The ethic does not.

---

## Status
Public-facing, early stage.
Architecture anchored. First modules and stories in progress.

If you want to help:
- test “signal” language in real households
- draft story envelopes
- prototype petal interfaces (paper, wood, cardboard, simple electronics)
you are welcome here.
